# EvaluatingLinearRegression
High variance vs High bias problem was tackled by:
a) Increasing/decreasing the number of features (variable: d).
b) Increasing/decreasing the regularization parameter (variable: regParam).
Increasing the features solved underfitting problem or high bias problem.
Increasing the regularization parameter solved overfitting problem or high variance problem.
Model was trained by training set, validated by cross validation set and tested by test set.
Training set and Cross Validation set gave almost the same value of cost function whereas Test set gave 1.5 times the value obtained in Training set or Cross Validation set.
